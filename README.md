# Overview

*LSSEFT* is a tool to perform calculations in the _effective field theory of large scale structure_. Currently it can perform the 1-loop calculations needed for the dark matter power spectrum in real and redshift-space. It can decompose the redshift-space power spectrum into Legendre modes, and it implements a resummation prescription that accounts for damping of the baryon acoustic oscillations due to displacements.

Future versions of *LSSEFT* may support more features. If you would like to contribute to this effort then any patches, corrections or enhancements are very welcome. The best way to start is to fork this repository and submit enhancements via [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests).

This version of *LSSEFT* has been written by David Seery at the University of Sussex.
